# Overview

This project focuses on building different types of autoencoders for anomaly detection. The goal is to train these autoencoders to reconstruct normal data sequences accurately while identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

# Vanilla Autoencoder:
A simple feedforward autoencoder.

# Variational Autoencoder (VAE):
Uses a probabilistic approach with mean and log variance vectors of dimension 3.

# LSTM-based Autoencoder: 
Captures temporal dependencies in sequential data.

# GAN-based Autoencoder:
Utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for anomaly detection.
